            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Virgil's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>1980</strong>
                     - Abloh was born on September 30 outside of Chicago. He and his sister are raised in nearby 
                    Rockford, by Ghanaian immigrant parents. His mother is a seamstress and teaches him the tricks of her trade. 
                    Abloh attends the Boylan Catholic High School and graduates in 1998. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2002</strong>
                     - Abloh completes his undergraduate degree in civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. 
                     Rumor has it that on the day of his graduation, he skips his final critique to take a meeting with Kanye West’s 
                     then-manager John Monopoly. West and Abloh begin working together soon after.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2006</strong>
                     - Abloh completes his master’s degree in architecture from the Illinois Institute of Technology. During his 
                     time at IIT, a Rem Koolhaas building is completed, which Abloh says, “piqued my interest and opened my gateway 
                     into fashion.”
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2009</strong>
                     - Abloh and West become interns at Fendi in Rome. Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke was really impressed with how 
                     Abloh and West brought a whole new vibe to the studio calling them "disruptive but in the best way".
                </li>
                    
                <li>

                     - Abloh and West, along with a crew of famous friends, make the rounds at Paris Fashion Week, turning heads in the 
                     process.  
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2010</strong>
                     - Abloh officially assumes the role of creative director at Donda, West’s creative agency.

                     - Abloh art directs the album Watch the Throne by Jay-Z and West, an achievement that earns him a Grammy nomination. 
                     The album cover is designed by Riccardo Tisci, then the creative director of Givenchy, a role Abloh was rumored to be 
                     up for after Tisci’s departure in 2017.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2012</strong>
                     - Abloh launches his first brand, Pyrex Vision, in New York. He purchased deadstock Ralph Lauren flannel shirts for $40 
                     each, and screen printed them with the word Pyrex and the number 23, an homage to his childhood hero, Michael Jordan. 
                     They sell for $550 each.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2013</strong>
                     - Abloh shutters Pyrex and founds Off-White, a multi-platform creative endeavor based in Milan. Its main medium is fashion.
                      At Off-White, he combines ideas of streetwear, luxury, art, music, and travel, defining the brand simply as, “the gray area
                      between black and white as the color Off-White.” From the get-go, hovering quotation marks become Abloh’s signature.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2014</strong>
                     - Abloh launches womenswear for Off-White and begins showing his men’s and women’s collections during Paris Fashion Week.

                <li>
                    <strong>2015</strong>
                     - Abloh’s womenswear operation gains steam when Beyoncé wears a palm-print sweatshirt with the word Nebraska on it, an homage 
                     to Raf Simons’s Fall 2002 Virginia Creepers collection, in Nicki Minaj’s video for “Feeling Myself.” That same year, Off-White 
                     is named a finalist for the LVMH Prize. He loses the grand prize and special prize to Marques’Almeida and Jacquemus, respectively.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2016</strong>
                     - Abloh opens his first concept store in the Aoyama area of Tokyo. The store features a watercooler with Off-White branded cups that visitors take for free and resell on the secondary market.

                     Abloh alsodebuts his Grey Area furniture collection in Milan, his first furniture venture under the Off-White brand. It features iron grid chairs, benches, and tables with leather cushions and Carrara marble tops.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2017</strong>
                     - Even with the announcement of a collaborative exhibition with Takashi Murakami opening at Gagosian; the release of his first song; the opening of his New York store; the British Fashion Award for Urban Luxe 
                     Brand; and collaborations with Warby Parker, Jacob the Jeweler, and Jimmy Choo, the biggest news for Abloh in 2017 is The Ten, his sneaker partnership with Nike. Abloh re-creates 10 of Nike’s iconic silhouettes 
                     in a work-in-progress style, each adorned with a safety tag around the laces. The limited release leaves the sneaker market hungry for more, and Abloh hosts panels and workshops with Nike and additional releases 
                     throughout the year.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2018</strong>
                     - Abloh is named the artistic director of Louis Vuitton’s menswear collections, stepping into the role vacated by his friend and mentor Kim Jones. He became the first Black creative director of a French luxury
                     fashion house.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2019</strong>
                    - Virgil Alboh’s artworks will be the subject of an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, and his Ikea collaboration will be released through the brand’s international stores. This is also the
                    year where Abloh was diagnosed with cardiac aniosarcoma, a rare type of cancer, which he kept very private.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2021</strong>
                    - Virgil Abloh unfortunately died on November 28, 2021 at the age of 41. He left behind a legacy in the fashion industry.
